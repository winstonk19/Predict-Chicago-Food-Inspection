🔍 Predicting Food Inspection Failures in Chicago | Data Science Sprint Challenge

Built a classification model to predict whether a food establishment in Chicago would fail its health inspection using real-world data from the Chicago Department of Public Health. The model is designed to optimize city resources by helping inspectors prioritize high-risk establishments before conducting onsite inspections.

Project Highlights:

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed time-indexed inspection data (2010–2019)

🔎 Identified and removed data leakage and irrelevant features

🧼 Implemented feature engineering with one-hot encoding and imputation pipelines

📊 Compared ensemble learning methods:

Bagging with Random Forest (best validation accuracy: 70.3%)

Boosting with GradientBoostingClassifier (best validation accuracy: 70.2%)

📉 Evaluated performance with baseline accuracy, ROC curves, and permutation importance

🧠 Included advanced techniques like Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) for model interpretation

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Category Encoders, PDPbox, Matplotlib

This project demonstrates my ability to translate messy, real-world datasets into actionable insights using machine learning and ensemble modeling techniques.
